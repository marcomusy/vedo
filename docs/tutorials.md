## Suggested Learning Path

1. Run a few scripts in `examples/basic/` and change parameters.
2. Move to `examples/advanced/` to understand scene composition.
3. Explore domain-specific folders (`pyplot`, `simulations`, `volumetric`) based on your use case.
4. Use the generated API docs to inspect class and method details while editing examples.
